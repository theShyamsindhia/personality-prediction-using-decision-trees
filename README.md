# Personality Type Prediction using Decision Tree-Based Models

This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict personality types based on given features. It utilizes **Decision Tree-based models**, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to classify personality traits.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares personality data.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Constructs a tree-based model for personality type classification.
- **Random Forest & Gradient Boosting**: Implements ensemble methods for improved accuracy.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies the most significant factors influencing predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸ“œ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `numpy` (Data handling)
- `scikit-learn` (ML models)
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Visualization)

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
