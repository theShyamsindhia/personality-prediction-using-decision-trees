# Personality Type Prediction using Decision Tree-Based Models  

Ever wondered if we could predict personality traits just by analyzing patterns in data? This project explores how **Decision Tree-based machine learning models** can classify personality types based on a set of features. By leveraging **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees**, this project attempts to capture the hidden structure behind personality classification.  

## 🧠 Why Personality Prediction?  
Personality assessments have been used in psychology, hiring, and even dating apps to better understand individuals. However, traditional personality tests rely on self-reported data, which can sometimes be **biased** or **inaccurate**.  
With **machine learning**, we aim to create a data-driven approach that can predict personality types based on structured input, removing human bias and making the process more scalable.  

## 🔬 What This Project Does  
- **Cleans and Prepares Data** → Handles missing values and formats personality trait data.  
- **Builds Decision Tree-Based Models** → Trains Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.  
- **Evaluates Model Performance** → Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess effectiveness.  
- **Analyzes Feature Importance** → Determines which factors influence personality classification the most.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
This project is built using:  
- 🐍 **Python**  
- 📊 **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- 🌳 **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models  
- 📈 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- 📝 **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
